Write a 1000-word SEO-friendly article with title {title}.

Include primary keywords: {keyword_1}, {keyword_2} and secondary keywords: {keyword_3}, {keyword_4}.

Go deep into the topic, and make it super informative.  Make sure to add facts and statistics. The tone should be informative and engaging.

The structure should be like this (do switch up the actual names of the headings and subheadings):

{custom_instructions}

Ensure the content is unique, offers valuable insights.  Ensure it adheres to SEO best practices. It should not feel like it was written by AI. Make up facts or points if you need to. 

Write from some additional unique angles in which we can approach this subject. Avoid keyword stuffing. The audience might be looking for ways to reduce anxiety, increase focus, performance, motivation, joy, etc. Try to help them see the benefits and evoke a sense of excitement to try out these new methods.

Make sure the article is no less than 1000 words.

I will be sending your response to an API call so I need it to be formatted in a specific way. Here are the formatting rules:
- Enclose headings with @@ (e.g., @@<Heading>@@)
- Enclose subheadings with !! (e.g., !!<Subheading>!!)
- Regular text for paragraphs.
- If you need to use quotes, only use single quotes '' not double quotes
- Don't output the article title
- Just output the article and nothing else
